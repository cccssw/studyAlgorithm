// Visibility states:
//
// - isVisible:  if the tab is visible (on screen). You may implement the
//               callbacks in order to enable/disable "background" tasks like
//               animations.
//               Callbacks:
//               - tabDidBecomeVisible
//               - tabDidResignVisible
//
// - isSelected: if the tab is the selected tab in its window. Note that a tab
//               can be selected withouth being visible (i.e. the window is
//               minimized or the app is hidden). If your tabs contain
//               user-interactive components, you should save and restore focus
//               by sublcassing the callbacks.
//               Callbacks:
//               - tabDidBecomeSelected
//               - tabDidResignSelected
//
// - isKey:      if the tab has the users focus. Only one tab in the application
//               can be key at a given time. (Note that the OS will automatically
//               restore any focus to user-interactive components.)
//               Callbacks:
//               - tabDidBecomeKey
//               - tabDidResignKey
